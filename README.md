# Distributed Order Processing System

A Go microservices system that processes orders across three services communicating over
**gRPC** (synchronous) and **Kafka** (asynchronous), backed by **MySQL** and **Redis**, with
**observability** (metrics + distributed tracing). This is a portfolio project — the goal is a
system small enough to defend every design decision in an interview, not feature count.

> Design rationale and open decisions live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (architecture, tech stack,
> decision log). Build sequencing lives in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). This README will grow into
> the full write-up (numbers, tradeoffs, "what I'd change at scale") in the final phase.

## Status

- **Phase 0 — Foundations**: done. Proto contracts, Docker Compose infra, Go workspace.
- **Phase 1 — Order service**: done. `CreateOrder` / `GetOrder` over gRPC, backed by MySQL.
- **Phase 2 — Inventory service + synchronous `Reserve`**: done. Row-lock `Reserve`/`Release`
  implemented and proven under `-race` (no oversell, idempotent on redelivery).
- **Phase 3 — Async messaging (Payment service + Kafka)**: done. `Order` publishes
  `OrderCreated`, `Payment` mock-charges and publishes the result, `Order` consumes it and
  updates status.
- **Phase 4 — Compensation + idempotency**: in progress. Consumer loops switched to
  `FetchMessage`/`CommitMessages` so failures redeliver on restart instead of silently
  auto-committing. Payment's idempotent redelivery handling (`process`) is implemented and
  verified live (real `CreateOrder` → `CONFIRMED` end to end; a redelivered `OrderCreated`
  reuses the existing `payment_id` instead of double-charging). Order's compensation path
  (`handlePaymentFailed` — release the reservation, cancel the order) is still stubbed with the
  proposed design, pending implementation.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full phase breakdown.

## Architecture

```
                    ┌──────────────┐   gRPC: Reserve/Release   ┌──────────────────┐
   client ─gRPC──▶  │   Order svc  │ ────────────────────────▶ │  Inventory svc   │
                    │  (orders DB) │                            │ (inventory DB +  │
                    └──────┬───────┘ ◀───────────────────────── │   Redis cache)   │
                           │            reserve result          └──────────────────┘
                           │
                     Kafka │ publishes OrderCreated
                           ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐   Kafka: PaymentCompleted / PaymentFailed
                    │  Payment svc │ ───────────────────────────────┐
                    │ (payments DB)│                                 │
                    └──────────────┘                                 ▼
                                                       Order svc consumes result,
                                                       updates order status
```

The Order→Inventory call is synchronous because an order can't be accepted without knowing
stock exists *now*. The Order→Payment path is asynchronous so payment latency doesn't block
order acceptance, and Kafka buffers/retries if Payment is down. This is a saga:
reserve → charge → confirm, with compensation (release stock, cancel order) on failure.
